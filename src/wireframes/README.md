# Android App Wireframe for Medical Documentation

This wireframe document outlines the architecture and components needed to build a dedicated Android application for medical documentation based on the existing web application.

## Application Structure

The Android application will be built using Capacitor to leverage the existing React codebase while incorporating native Android capabilities. This approach allows for code reuse while optimizing the experience for Android devices.

## Key Components

1. **Authentication System**
   - Google Sign-In integration
   - Secure token storage using Android KeyStore
   - Biometric authentication for additional security

2. **Voice Recording Module**
   - Optimized for Android microphone access
   - Background recording capability
   - Android notification for recording status
   - Audio processing optimized for mobile CPU/memory constraints

3. **Transcription System**
   - Server-side processing for heavy transcription tasks
   - Local caching of results
   - Offline queue for uploads when connectivity is restored

4. **SOAP Note Generation**
   - AI-powered formatting using the transcription
   - Template customization
   - Export to common formats (PDF, FHIR)

5. **Image Analysis**
   - Direct camera integration
   - Gallery access
   - Optimized image processing pipeline

6. **User Dashboard**
   - Recent activity tracking
   - Quick actions
   - Personalization settings

7. **Subscription Management**
   - Google Play billing integration
   - Subscription status tracking
   - Receipt validation

## Native Features Implementation

The Android app will leverage these native capabilities:

1. **Microphone Access**
   - Higher quality recording than web
   - Background recording capability
   - Audio focus management

2. **Camera Integration**
   - Direct camera access for medical imaging
   - Image stabilization and enhancement
   - QR/barcode scanning for patient info

3. **File System**
   - Secure storage of medical data
   - Automatic backup options
   - Document provider integration

4. **Notifications**
   - Processing status updates
   - Recording indicators
   - Appointment reminders

5. **Offline Support**
   - Local data persistence
   - Background sync when online

6. **Share Extensions**
   - Share notes with other medical apps
   - Export to EHR systems

## Data Architecture

The app will use a combination of:
- SQLite for local storage
- Secure file storage for recordings and images
- Encrypted preferences for settings
- React Query for API state management
- Context API for global state

## Security Considerations

- All medical data will be encrypted at rest
- Biometric authentication for app access
- Network security configuration
- Automatic session timeout
- Secure window flags to prevent screenshots

## Android Marketplace Optimization

- Play Store listing optimization
- In-app review prompts
- A/B testing capability for UI enhancements
- Analytics integration for usage patterns
- Crash reporting and performance monitoring

## Development Approach

1. Initialize Capacitor project
2. Implement core native plugins
3. Optimize UI for Android material design
4. Add Android-specific navigation patterns
5. Implement background services
6. Add offline support
7. Integrate with Google Play billing
8. Security hardening
9. Performance optimization
10. Testing on multiple Android devices/versions

This wireframe serves as a comprehensive guide for developing the Android application with feature parity to the web version while leveraging native capabilities for an enhanced user experience.
